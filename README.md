# OpenAPI Specification

The OpenAPI Specification (originally known as the Swagger Specification) is a
specification for machine-readable interface files for describing, producing,
consuming, and visualizing RESTful Web services. A variety of tools can generate
code, documentation and test cases given an interface file. Development of the
OpenAPI Specification (OAS) is overseen by the Open API Initiative, an open
source collaborative project of the Linux Foundation.

For more information about the current specification:

## ACT Voyager

The ACT Voyager project was split up in a few components, one of them was about
setting up an API server.

Without pinning on specific technologies, the OAS conform description of such
API will be extremely useful.
